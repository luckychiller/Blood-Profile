In clinical medical diagnosis, automatic detection
and classification of blood cells has a great demand. Traditional
methods like hematology analyzer or manual count are laborious,
takes a lot of time and depends on the accuracy of analystsâ€™
knowledge and expertise. An improved version of YOLOv7 is
provided in this paper for detecting and classifying blood cells
automatically. First, from among the large number of detection
classes, in this version they are reduced down to three blood
cells classes in the modified YOLOv7 model. In addition, some
unnecessary layers have been removed from the model to develop
a robust detection system capable of identifying various blood
cells with high accuracy. To ensure accessibility and ease of
use, we designed a user-friendly website interface that allows
users to upload a single blood slide image and receive the results
in under ten seconds. The detection results are generated in a
comprehensive PDF report, facilitating immediate and effective
analysis by healthcare professionals. This automation not only
streamlines the diagnostic process but also significantly reduces
the time and effort required, ultimately contributing to improved
patient care and medical outcomes. The model working on the
dataset, for 20 epochs, provides the output that detects three
different types of blood cells, with an accuracy of 78%. Moreover,
the fast detection and high accuracy have opened the way
for computer-aid diagnostic systems in the future.
