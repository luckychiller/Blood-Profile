    "# Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Blood Profile Automation\" project addresses the significant demand for automated detection and classification of blood cells (BCs) in clinical diagnostics. Traditional methods, including hematology analyzers and manual counting, are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and dependent on the professional expertise of analysts. Our project aims to simplify and enhance the efficiency of BC detection by leveraging machine learning techniques. Utilizing the YOLOv7 model, we have developed a robust detection system capable of identifying various blood cells with high accuracy. To ensure accessibility and ease of use, we designed a user-friendly website interface that allows users to upload a single blood slide image and receive the results in under ten seconds. The detection results are generated in a comprehensive PDF report, facilitating immediate and effective analysis by healthcare professionals. This automation not only streamlines the diagnostic process but also significantly reduces the time and effort required, ultimately contributing to improved patient care and medical outcomes"

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Blood profiling, which entails measuring various components of blood including red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets, is a fundamental aspect of medical diagnostics. Traditional methods for blood profiling, such as hematology analyzers and manual counting by technicians, are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and subject to the professional experience and knowledge of the analysts. These limitations can lead to increased healthcare costs, error-prone results, and compromised patient care, especially in resource-constrained settings like in villages. To address these challenges, there is an urgent need for automated solutions that can streamline processes and improve the accessibility and accuracy of diagnostic services.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "A Complete Blood Count (CBC) is a common medical diagnostic test that provides a detailed overview of the cellular components of blood. Human blood consists of plasma and cellular components, which include platelets (thrombocytes), red blood cells (erythrocytes), and white blood cells (leukocytes). RBCs are responsible for delivering oxygen to tissues and removing carbon dioxide. WBCs play a crucial role in the immune system, defending the body against infections and diseases. Platelets are essential for blood clotting and wound healing. Anomalies in the counts and types of these cells can indicate various health conditions, such as anemia, infections, leukemia, and other diseases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional methods of blood cell analysis, such as the hemocytometer and hematology analyzers, often require manual counting to confirm abnormal results. Manual counting is not only time-consuming but also requires highly skilled analysts, making it prone to errors and inefficiencies. With the advancements in deep learning (DL) techniques, there is an increasing interest in leveraging these technologies to automate blood cell detection and classification based on blood smear images.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview of YOLOv7 Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project utilizes the YOLOv7 model for blood cell detection. YOLO, which stands for \"You Only Look Once,\" is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy. YOLOv7 builds upon previous versions by incorporating several enhancements to improve performance. The architecture of YOLOv7 includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extended Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks (E-ELAN)**: This design strategy focuses on controlling the longest shortest gradient path, enabling a deeper network to learn and converge more effectively. E-ELAN uses expand, shuffle, and merge cardinality to enhance the learning ability of the network without disrupting the gradient path.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Model Scaling**: YOLOv7 employs a compound scaling method for concatenation-based models. This approach adjusts the depth of computational blocks and the width of transition layers simultaneously, maintaining the optimal structure of the model and ensuring efficient hardware utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "These architectural innovations allow YOLOv7 to achieve faster and more accurate inferences, making it an ideal choice for real-time applications like blood cell detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Related Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerous studies have explored the application of deep learning techniques for blood cell detection and classification. For instance, researchers have developed models using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify RBCs, WBCs, and platelets from blood smear images. These models have demonstrated high accuracy and robustness, significantly outperforming traditional methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In one study, a deep learning model was used to classify different types of WBCs, achieving a high degree of accuracy and reducing the need for manual intervention. Another study employed a CNN-based approach to detect malaria-infected RBCs, providing a reliable and efficient alternative to manual examination. These works highlight the potential of deep learning in automating and improving blood cell analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, many of these models are either too complex for real-time applications or lack the necessary accuracy for clinical use. Our project addresses these gaps by utilizing the YOLOv7 model, which combines high speed and accuracy, making it suitable for real-time blood cell detection. By developing a user-friendly web interface, we aim to provide an accessible and efficient tool for healthcare professionals to perform blood profiling and enhance patient care.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging the advanced capabilities of the YOLOv7 model, our project aims to automate the detection and classification of blood cells, providing a faster, more accurate, and cost-effective solution for clinical diagnostics. This innovation holds the potential to significantly improve healthcare outcomes, particularly in resource-limited settings."

    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our blood profile machine learning project leverages the power of YOLOv7, a state-of-the-art object detection framework. YOLOv7 is known for its exceptional speed and accuracy, making it ideal for real-time applications. In our model, we have customized the architecture to suit our specific needs, utilizing CSPDarknet53 as the backbone, and integrating several unique components to enhance performance. This detailed description walks through the entire model architecture, from input to output, highlighting each stage and its specific function.\n",
    "[yolo image]\n",
    "\n",
    "Backbone:\n",
    "The backbone of our model is CSPDarknet53, a robust feature extractor designed to capture essential characteristics from the input images. CSPDarknet53 is composed primarily of convolutional layers, which progressively downsample the input image and extract hierarchical features. The key components of our backbone include:\n",
    "[CSPDarknet53 image]\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial Convolution Layers: \n",
    "The initial layers consist of basic convolution operations designed to capture low-level features such as edges and textures. These layers are:\n",
    "   - Conv layer [3, 32, 3, 1]: A 3x3 convolution with 32 filters.\n",
    "   - Conv layer [32, 64, 3, 2]: A 3x3 convolution with 64 filters and a stride of 2 for downsampling.\n",
    "   - Conv layer [64, 64, 3, 1]: A 3x3 convolution with 64 filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Downsampling and Feature Aggregation: As we move deeper into the network, the convolutions increase in filter size and are often followed by downsampling operations to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps:\n",
    "   - Conv layer [64, 128, 3, 2]: A 3x3 convolution with 128 filters, followed by another set of convolutions that refine these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cross Stage Partial (CSP) Blocks: These blocks are designed to enhance the learning capability of the network by partitioning the feature map of the base layer into two parts and then merging them through a cross-stage hierarchy. This setup helps in gradient flow and reduces computation cost.\n",

    "Neck: \n",
    "Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and Path Aggregation Network (PAN)\n",

    "1. Input: The input is a two-dimensional array representing the image, typically with three color channels (RGB).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Backbone Processing: The input image is processed through the CSPDarknet53 backbone, where it undergoes multiple convolutional operations and feature extraction stages. Each stage progressively captures more complex features, from edges and textures to more abstract patterns.\n",

    "3. **Additional Metrics**:\n",
    "   - Compute additional metrics such as the Mean Average Precision (mAP) to get a more comprehensive view of the model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualization**:\n",
    "   - Use the `test_batch2_pred.jpg` and other visualizations to see how the model predictions compare to the ground truth visually.\n",

The model effectively detects and classifies Platelets, RBCs, and WBCs from blood samples. The confusion matrix indicates that the model achieves high accuracy, particularly for WBCs, with a true positive rate of 1.00. However, there are areas for improvement, particularly in reducing false positives and false negatives for Platelets and RBCs.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**:\n",
    "   - Experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) and use techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization to find the optimal settings for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Advanced Architectures**:\n",
    "   - Explore more advanced model architectures or combinations of models to improve detection and classification performance. This could include ensembling methods or integrating additional layers tailored to the specific characteristics of blood cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Error Analysis and Model Refinement**:\n",
    "   - Conduct thorough error analysis to understand the common failure modes of the model. Use this insight to refine the model, possibly incorporating domain-specific knowledge about blood cell morphology.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Integration with Clinical Workflows**:\n",
    "   - Work towards integrating the model into clinical workflows, ensuring it meets the necessary regulatory standards and can be used reliably by healthcare professionals.\n",
